# DeepLearning_Project2

This project is based on the traditional Vision-Transformer (ViT) model, using a multi-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the original input data, and then feed the filtered patches into ViT for training. The robustness of the hybrid model is expected to be enhanced by the accuracy of the CNN on small datasets and the accuracy of the ViT model on large datasets. We compared the accuracy of the original VIT model and the combined CNN-ViT model via the KMINST dataset. With the multi-layer CNN being added, the revised combined CNN-ViT model achieved an 91.56% accuracy. 

The final coding part shows in `project2-vitwith3conv.ipynb` file.
